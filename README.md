This is an additional material for week 14 of ITCS431 Software Design and Developent class. The project provides example code to explain the design criteria concept (Law of Demeter, cohesion, coupling, etc.)

It is organized as follows:
1. For an example of the law of Demeter (example taken from [https://www.infoworld.com/article/3136224/demystifying-the-law-of-demeter-principle.html](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3136224/demystifying-the-law-of-demeter-principle.html)), see the package `demeter`.
2. For an example of coupling types, see the package `coupling`.
